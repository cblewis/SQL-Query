# SQL-Query
I wrote this to query a SQL server and output the result into a .csv file. This saves a few steps and makes copying and pasting easier.

Both files were made to automate two separate queries to two separate SQL servers. Runnign these scripts saves time, eliminates the need for opening SQL and copying the query.
Both write the data obtained from the query to a CSV file.
